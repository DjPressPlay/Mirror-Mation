Mirror‑Mation: ZETSU × FIBO AI Animation Studio, ready to start tomorrow:

1. Core Concept

Purpose: Modular AI-powered animation studio.

Pipeline: Emulator / asset capture → FIBO AI edits → Timeline/Animator → Final output.

Key Features:

Multi-layer AI (BG, characters, interactions).

Custom timeline editor for scene/frame orchestration.

Reusable styles, templates, and JSON-driven AI instructions.

Branching frames for variation and interpolation.

2. Layers

Background Layer (BG)

Static or dynamic scene generation.

Templates and AI-generated variations.

Pre-render for heavy assets to save computation.

Character Layer

AI generates poses, costumes, and actions per frame.

Handles frame-by-frame animation.

Supports branching frames for variations.

Interaction Layer

Triggers: props, effects, UI events.

Timeline-based control.

Synchronizes character and BG changes.

3. Timeline Editor

Visual interface for sequencing frames/scenes.

Allows:

Cross-scene edits (BG swaps, event triggers).

Section grouping for pre-rendering.

AI layer assignment per frame/section.

4. Workflow

Import assets or capture from emulator/game engine.

Define timeline and sections.

Assign AI layers to frames/sections.

Use FIBO AI to generate/edit frames (dressing, style, props).

Optional: Frame interpolation or motion generation.

Preview timeline → tweak frames → export final animation/video.

5. Storage / File Management

File bin: stores frames, layers, templates, and AI-generated variations.

Branching support: easy to swap styles, backgrounds, or character edits globally.

6. Optional Enhancements

Style presets for different eras/themes.

Multi-AI integration for specialized edits (e.g., color grading, effects).

Realtime preview mode for immediate feedback.

Export to common video formats or interactive web modules.
